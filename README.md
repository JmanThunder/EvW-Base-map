# East vs. West Mapping Project for Victoria II
###  Welcome to the East vs West Map Project 
###  This is a modification for Victoria II (ofc) that ports the EvW Map to Victoria 2
###  Plans:
###  - 1836 map to a playable extent with pops, provinces and gameplay changes to suit
###  - Possibly new RGOs but depends on how the mapping turns out
###  - Fixes and integration of V2 mechanics 
###  - Modernization and rework of existing and new Victoria 2-style flavor
###  More info coming soon...
